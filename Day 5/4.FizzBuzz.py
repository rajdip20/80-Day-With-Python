'''
You are going to write a program that automatically prints the solution to the FizzBuzz game.

Your program should print each number from 1 to 100 in turn.

When the number is divisible by 3 then instead of printing the number it should print "Fizz".

When the number is divisible by 5, then instead of printing the number it should print "Buzz".`

And if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 e.g. 15 then instead of the number it should print "FizzBuzz"

#Write your code below this row 👇

for i in range(1, 101):
    if(i % 3 == 0 and i % 5 == 0):
        print("FizzBuzz")
    elif(i % 3 == 0):
        print("Fizz")
    elif(i % 5 == 0):
        print("Buzz")
    else:
        print(i)
